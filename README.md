# youtube-clone 

In this project I've tried to create a video sharing app where one can share their videos, like and comment on other videos basically cloning the whole functionality and UI of YouTube. As of now, routing and database have been implemented on the server side whereas the whole YouTube similar UI has been developed on the frontend side.
