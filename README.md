# youtube-clone 

In this project I've tried to create a video sharing app where one can share their videos, like and comment on other videos, basically cloning the whole functionality and UI of YouTube. As of now, routing and database have been implemented on the server side whereas the whole YouTube similar UI has been developed on the frontend side. 

## Get started

1. Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/mihir224/youtube-clone`

2. Run
   
`npm install`

3. Update your mongoDB credentials in the env file

4. Then, in both the client and server directories, run separately:

`npm start`

the project would be accessible at `localhost:3000`
